In this website you will find out a little about me, my passions, and some of the projects I created during the GIS labcourse. 
<br>
The content of the website aims to illustrate the set of skills the "Geographical information systems" course has brought me, as well exploring GIS as more than just a science but as a reflection of one's creativity and personal conceptions.
