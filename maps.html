<h1>Maps I made</h1>
<nav id="nav01"></nav>


</p>
<p>All throughout my GIS course I have learned how to create and format maps.
Here is where I will share the maps I created, with the help of many online tools and softwares (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS online and Google Earth Engine).

<br>
<p><b>1) Choropleth map of SDG indicator 5.4.1 </b>
<br>
<br>
For this map, I selected one of the indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations, and created an online choropleth map with the data. Choropleth maps use colour scales to describe different values for different geographic distributions, which as you can see in my case is different shades of red. I selected indicator 5.4.1 for the "Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic chores and care work by sex, age and location in percentage‚Äù because it allowed me to explore out of my confort zone and personal interests (such as nature or land related indicators). To make the map more traditional-looking, the assignment required a change in projection and of visible features (such as color palette, title, name, SDG number, etc.). As hinted previously, I chose red because I thought it emphasized well the very important data that was measured, while complementing the grey of the missing data. I also added a compass indicating the North, just as a simple detail that impacted the visual representation, but also the clearness of the overall project. </p>

<p><b>2) Creating a map using Google Earth Engine </b>
<br>
<br>
For this map created on Google Earth Engine, I selected a location between the very North of Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and a small fraction of Germany. Google Earth Earth is a cloud-based remote sensing tool that has direct access to more than forty years of satellite imagery and, unlike QGIS and ArcGIS Pro, uses easier and more straightforward processes to approach maps or tables. In my case, the first layer that immediately catches the eye illustrates the variation in elevation at the selected zone. By clicking on the link below, it is also possible to see the map more detailedly and analyze an additional false composite layer (with a band composite of B12-B11-B2) that is optimal to indicate the geologic processes in the zone (such as faults, lithology, and geologic formation). In the assignment, I was also asked to change the time period at which the information was collected, and it was curious to see how much the colors changed 
for the geologic layer</p>

<p><b>3) Interactive online map of Road accidents in 2016</b>
<br>
<br>
This online interactive map, made with the ArcGIS online tool, indicates Road accidents in 2016 worldwide. I was unfortunately unable to use the SDG indicator I used for the Static Choropleth on domestic chores and carework, but I was still intrigued to learn more about an indicator I would have personally never explored like Traffic accidents. Thanks to the online GIS, I could change the legend colors to my liking and ameliorate visible features. All ocean-borders of the countries have a darker drop-shadow effect that emphasizes the brown colors of the data, which I selected to obtain a more traditional-looking map. Clicking on any location allows the viewer to discover the specific values of the selected country and even look at a traffic image I uploaded through Pop-ups to get a better idea of how the map works. </p>

<p> <b>4) QR code for a personalized web app </b>
<br>
<br>
The app I created using "Field Maps Designer" is called "Peace and Tranquility of the Surroundings", and it evaluates through a set of questions the general ambiance of a specific location. Unlike the maps that were previously explored, this interactive app leaves space for the user to personalize the data, while still providing useful information on a selected location. For my app, I decided to focus on the ambiance of the surroundings at a certain location, asking, for example, questions on the sense of safety or even the sense of tranquility. I then personalized my app by adding visual features, such as green symbols for all collected data. After scanning the QR code (which can be found down below), the questionnaire appears when one selects a point, and it even asks for a picture!
