<h1>Maps I made</h1>
<nav id="nav01"></nav>


</p>
<p>All throughout my GIS course I have learned how to create and format maps.
Here is where I will share the maps I created, with the help of many online tools and softwares (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS online and Google Earth Engine).

<p><b>1) Choropleth map of SDG indicator 5.4.1 </b>
<br>
<br>
For this lab assignment, we had to select one of the indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations, and create an online choropleth map with the data. I selected indicator 5.4.1 and obtained the starting point of my prject. To make the map more traditional-looking, the assignment required a change in projection and of visible features (such as color palette, title, name, SDG number, etc.). I chose red because it emphasized well the very important data that was measured. I also added a compass indicating the North, just as a simple detail that impacted the visual representation overall. </p>

<p><b>2) Creating a map using Google Earth Engine </b>
<br>
<br>
For this map created on Google Earth Engine, I selected a location between the very North of Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and a small fraction of Germany. The first layer that immediately catches the eye illustrates the variation in elevation at the selected zone. By clicking on the link below, it is also possible to see the map more detailedly and analyze an additional false composite layer underneath the elevation that is optimal to indicate the geologic processes in the zone (such as faults, lithology, and geologic formation).

<p><b>3) Interactive online map of Road accidents in 2016</b>
<br>
<br>
This online interactive map, made with the ArcGIS online tool, indicates Road accidents in 2016 worldwide. Thanks to the online software, I could change the legend colors to my liking and ameliorate visible features. Clicking on any location also allows the viewer to discover the specific values of the selected country and even look at a traffic image I uploaded through Pop-ups in the online tool. </p>

<p> <b>4) QR code for a personalized web app </b>
<br>
<br>
The app I created using "Field Maps Designer" is called Peace and Tranquility of the Surroundings, and it evaluates through a set of questions the general ambiance of a specific location. For example, one of the questions discusses the sense of safety in a chosen location or even the sense of tranquility. On the app, after scanning the QR code, the questionnaire appears when one selects a point on the map, and it even asks for a picture! 
As an addition to the maps, the app allows more interaction for the viewers/users and give them the space to personalize their data through subjective answers while still adding to my research.
