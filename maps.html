<h1>Maps I made</h1>
<nav id="nav01"></nav>


</p>
<p>All throughout my GIS course I have learned how to create and format maps.
Here is where I will share the maps I created, with the help of many online tools and softwares (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS online and Google Earth Engine).

<br>
<p><b>1) Choropleth map of SDG indicator 5.4.1 </b>
<br>
<br>
For this map, I selected one of the indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations, and created an online choropleth map with the data. Choropleth maps use colour scales to describe different values for different geographic distributions, which as you can see in my case is different shades of red. I selected indicator 5.4.1 for the "Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic chores and care work by sex, age and location in percentage‚Äù because I thought it allowed to explore out of my confort zone and personal interest (such as nature or land related indicators). To make the map more traditional-looking, the assignment required a change in projection and of visible features (such as color palette, title, name, SDG number, etc.). As hinted previously, I chose red because I thought it emphasized well the very important data that was measured, while complementing well the grey of the missing data. I also added a compass indicating the North, just as a simple detail that impacted the visual representation overall, but also the clearness of the overall project. </p>

<p><b>2) Creating a map using Google Earth Engine </b>
<br>
<br>
For this map created on Google Earth Engine, I selected a location between the very North of Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and a small fraction of Germany. This Google remote sensing tool is a cloud-based software that has direct access to more than forty years of satellite imagery and, unlike QGIS and ArcGIS Pro, uses easier and more straightforward processes to approach maps or tables. In my case, the first layer that immediately catches the eye illustrates the variation in elevation at the selected zone. By clicking on the link below, it is also possible to see the map more detailedly and analyze an additional false composite layer (with a band composite of B12-B11-B2) underneath the elevation that is optimal to indicate the geologic processes in the zone (such as faults, lithology, and geologic formation). In the assignment, I was also asked to change the time period at which the information was collected, and it was curious to see how much the colors differenced 
for the geologic layer</p>

<p><b>3) Interactive online map of Road accidents in 2016</b>
<br>
<br>
This online interactive map, made with the ArcGIS online tool, indicates Road accidents in 2016 worldwide. I was unfortunately unable to use the SDG indicator I used for the Static Choropleth on domestic chores and carework, but I was still intrigued to learn more about an indicator I would have personally never explored like Traffic accidents. Thanks to the online GIS, I could change the legend colors to my liking and ameliorate visible features. Clicking on any location allows the viewer to discover the specific values of the selected country and even look at a traffic image I uploaded through Pop-ups to get a better idea of how the map works. </p>

<p> <b>4) QR code for a personalized web app </b>
<br>
<br>
The app I created using "Field Maps Designer" is called "Peace and Tranquility of the Surroundings", and it evaluates through a set of questions the general ambiance of a specific location. Using the online mapp tool was For example, one of the questions discusses the sense of safety in a chosen location or even the sense of tranquility. On the app, after scanning the QR code, the questionnaire appears when one selects a point on the map, and it even asks for a picture! 
As an addition to the maps, the app allows more interaction for the viewers/users and give them the space to personalize their data through subjective answers while still adding to my research.
