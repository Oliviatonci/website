<h1>About me</h1>
<nav id="nav01"></nav>
<br>
<p> My Name is <b>Olivia Tonci </b>
<br>
<br>
I am a first year Italian student at <b> Utrecht University College </b>. During my years at UCU, I plan on majoring in <b>Biology </b>(either physiology or molecular biology) and <b>Earth and Environment</b>. These subjects have always interested me, and growing up in a country like Italy I was always surrounded by green parks and diverse nature. Walking around Villa Borghese or Villa Pamphilij always triggered a sense of curiosity that I have been rediscovering through my education.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b> Geographical information systems</b> is the first real lab course I have taken in my academic career. I chose it mainly out of curiosity for something I never experienced beforehand. Before taking this course, I was unaware of <b>the complexity of cartographic representations </b> -that I use daily-the long hours of layout adjustments and the data analysis necessary before obtaining a clear map. I also thought the course could benefit my future academic career. Especially in Earth and Environment, knowing how to use complex mapping software and, e.g., analyzing land distribution in areas through GIS tools are very useful skills that I have yet to consider.
